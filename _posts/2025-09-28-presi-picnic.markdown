### A Second Self-Shuttled Speedier Super Summit Selfie Spectacular

My running goals for the 2025 season were Cactus-to-Clouds (C2C2C) and the Grand Canyon's Rim-to-Rim (R2R2R). Then my van broke down and the North Rim burned to the ground and I was on the East Coast; so I shifted a little - my new goals were running a Presidential Traverse and a Pemigewasset Loop.

Finding myself at the Crawford Notch Trailhead on a Saturday night with a reasonable weather window on Sunday, I decided it was time to check that first one off the list - even if I had just [hiked it with friends]({% post_url 2025-09-27-presi-hike %}) the previous day. However, now that my friends were on their way back to Boston, I would need a way to shuttle myself between trailheads. Fortunately I had thought ahead and brought my bike. Apparently this too is [a thing](https://fastestknowntime.com/node/6630). After some headlamp-lit repacking in the Gorham Subway parking lot, I slept in the back of my parents' old minivan on a forest road, excited for the adventure to come.

### The Bike
I woke up around 6:30 and, after a fruitless search for an open bathroom and a fruitful cat-hole, bungeed my running vest onto my bike and set off.

While the current FKT route takes the road from Crawford Notch to Valley Way, I decided on the - in my opinion - more aesthetic route, taking Mt. Clinton Road to Jefferson Notch Road; and then the Presidential Rail Trail. I also decided, unlike the FKT, to bike first. I had discussed this with Calvin the previous day, and we decided the advantages were:
- I am more confident in my time/energy/pacing on the run, while it was harder to figure out how much to save for the bike
- I didn't have lights for the bike, and did not want to be stuck biking in the dark if my run went long
- On the off-chance someone stole my bike while it was parked at the trailhead, it would be after I had already used it rather than leaving me stranded.

I headed up Mt. Clinton Road, which was relatively well-paved throughout.

After crossing the road that leads to the Washington Cog Railway base station, I proceeded onto Mt. Jefferson Road, which quickly became a dirt road. Given my wide tires I continued on without much trouble and slowly but steadily climbed up to Jefferson Notch.

The downhill after the notch was fairly steep, and I had to stop several times and readjust my gear to ensure it wouldn't fall off the back of the bike. Once the road flattened again I continued on to the Rail Trail. This was a lovely long, flat, straight gravel trail, with generous views  of the range I was about to traverse off to my right.

I arrived at the trailhead, locked my bike to a tree, put on my running vest, and after a brief chat with the Forest Service Volunteer headed off into the woods up Valley Way.

Obviously there is a huge energy difference doing this fresh rather than after running a @#$%^& 4:08 Presi, but given that I as a relative amateur with minimal bike-specific training and a heavy bike did this just 2 minutes slower than the FKT bike split I think my route might be the way to go...

### The Run
I had a big case of the dropsies on this whole effort. About 2 miles up Valley Way I realized I had left a pocket unzipped and lost my wind jacket. I knew I wouldn't have the energy to go back in and look for it once out of the woods, so I decided to head back. The kind Forest Service volunteer had found it about 15 minutes up the trail and taken it back to the trailhead, and while they apologized for adding even more distance, I was very glad that someone had found it and I was able to get it back. After that I proceeded up Valley Way once more - realizing a few miles in that I had also managed to drop a soft flask, likely during the bike ride. This one I was unable to find, even though I went and drove Mt Clinton and Jefferson Notch Road at the end of the day to look for it. Such is life. After that things proceeded uneventfully. I won't bore you with another full description of the hike (go read Saturday's trip report for that), so enjoy the Summit Selfie Series:

A random collection of thoughts and moments:
- I carried 1.5L of water (although I meant to take 2) and refilled at Madison Hut and the Mt. Washington Visitor Center. I could have filtered at Lake of the Clouds or descending after Pierce but didn't need to.
- I consumed ~45g carbs/hr spread between Nature's Bakery Fig Bars, homemade energy gels, and nerds gummy clusters.
  - A note on homemade gels - making them in a blender incorporates a lot of air, making it hard to actually fill the container efficiently and thus resulting in lower volume than I had hoped. This air also expands when you ascend, which can lead to aggressive spillage when you first open the flask.
  - I took a saltStick pill every 45 minutes which I think worked fine
- While the windiest moment of the weekend was Mt. Madison on Saturday, Sunday was more consistently windy - it never really stopped. It was also far more cloudy, and my Washington summit was entirely socked in (although it was clear an hour before and after I summitted, of course). However I don't think the weather affected my performance or enjoyment
- I took way too much gear that I didn't use - although I'm sure I would have been glad for it had I gotten hurt and had to walk out. 
- My wind shirt doesn't fit over my running vest so there's no reason to carry it in an external pocket as I have to take the vest off anyways. I ended up putting it on for about 15 minutes descending Washington and was fine in my Sun Hoodie the rest of the time
- My cardio was not the limiting factor on this run - my hear rate stayed surprisingly low. I was limited by my leg muscles feeling heavy, and by the technicality of the terrain. Even if I were to run this in one-mile increments I'm not sure I'd have been able to go much faster without hurting myself.
- I SAW A MOOSE FOR THE FIRST TIME IN MY LIFE! IT WALKED RIGHT ACROSS THE TRAIL COMING DOWN FROM PIERCE! I did not manage to take a photo.

I maintain that the Presi is the most scenic hike I've done in the Northeast. I'm proud of myself for checking this goal off the list, and for being able to do something like this car-to-car with a bike shuttle without having to do any part of it in the dark. The goal isn't to be fastest, it's to be fast enough to be able to fully experience the trip, and I accomplished just that.
