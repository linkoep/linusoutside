After the usual family festivities back East, I started my year in San Diego where I had been surfing before the holidays. The good news: I had a [ski trip]({% post_url 2025-01-18-brew-hut %}) planned with some friends the following weekend. The bad news: It was in British Columbia.

Well - I had a whole week, so why not do some skiing?

After the obligatory stops at the Eastern Sierra Visitor Center (bathrooms, water, cool info about Death Valley) and Schat's <s>Bakery</s> BakkerÃ¿ (Bacon Asiago Cheese Bread and a Pullaway) I made it to Mammoth in time for an afternoon of skiing. It was... fine - I still haven't had a true Mammoth powder day, even managing to pick the one week in the record-breaking 2023 season where it didn't snow at all. I'll get it some dayðŸ¤ž

Hope you weren't expecting good photos from this blog... I'd say I'm working on it, but really I just take a bunch and hope some of them turn out okay.

I considered a stop in Tahoe the following day, but given that I was back on the road by 4:00pm it seemed inefficient to drive only 3 more hours and post up for the night. I still haven't skiied any Tahoe resorts either - on the list for 2026 I guess. I spent Monday driving and working (believe it or not I do have a day job), placing myself in the Mt. Bachelor Sno-Park Monday night.

While I maintain my snobbishness about Utah Powder, I'm a huge fan of the PNW's accessibility for skiing out of a van. In Salt Lake you're sleeping in some parking lot in the valley and in Mammoth you're hoping there's a plowed spot on the scenic loop or trying to sneak a spot in town. Meanwhile Oregon and Washington seem to have a public Sno-Park within 10 minutes of most of their resorts, well-plowed, with bathrooms, and permits are under $50 for the season. 

Mount Bachelor was super cool in terms of layout - my first time skiing a volcano, and being able to ski off the summit in any direction was incredible.

The snow itself was unfortunately once again sub-optimal. It was super interesting to experience the mountain's temperature gradient - rock hard at the top and slushy at the bottom - but it made for a "good snow zone" of what felt like only a few hundred feet in the middle. I also really put my ski edges to the test recovering from a slip in an icy chute - one of my more memorable close calls of the season.

From there it was a straightforward drive to meet my friends in Seattle, where I arrived Wednesday night (maybe I should have thrown in that Tahoe stop?). 1500 miles and two ski resorts in 4 days - not a bad start to the year!
