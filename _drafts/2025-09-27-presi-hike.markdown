Every summer I lose the majority of my friends to the sport of ultimate frisbee (which to be fair is how I made those friends in the first place, but still) - finally the season was over, and there was East Coast hiking to be done. Matt, Calvin, En Le and I decided to try hiking the Presidential Traverse in New Hampshire in a single day. While Matt had backpacked the route previously, and the rest of the group had attempted but not completed a two-day trip; I had never entered the Presidential Range at all, and was looking forward to what I'd ultimately say was the most scenic hike I've done in the Northeast.

We drove up to New Hampshire after work on Friday, checking into the motel after their front desk closed, and leaving before it opened again. Having left my car at the Crawford Notch trailhead the previous night, we headed to Valley Way for a bright (well, dark) and early 6:00 am start.

We started making our way up the trail by our headlamps - Valley Way is a fairly standard New Hampshire trail, rocky and treed with minimal switchback, but we made good progress and found ourselves with the beginnings of a nice view by the time it was light.

We soon made it into the alpine, where we were greeted with a stern warning. Having checked the forecast, our only worry was the high winds, and knowing we had the appropriate gear we carried on.

After a brief stop at Madison Hut, we began our first summit of the day - a rocky path up Mt. Madison.

The forecast wind did indeed appear as we made our way above treeline, making for a very chaotic first summit of the day at around 8:30 am.

We hurried back down, and after another brief stop at the hut to refill water, continued onwards. Things remained rocky as we made our way around the base of J.Q. Adams, but the wind was far less strong off the summit and we enjoyed the sunshine as we cruised through the alpine.

After another windy summit, we descended back towards the Appalachian Trail and began to make our way towards Mt. Jefferson

The trail steepened again as we approached the Mt. Jefferson summit, culminating in a short scramble up the summit rock pile.
