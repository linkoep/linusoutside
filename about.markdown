# About Me

Hi! I'm Linus. I live in a van and do dumb stuff outside. Here's some of it

# About this site
I'm not a great photographer, and generally try to spend minimal time on social media, which led me to look for a way of sharing my adventures that wasn't posting on Instagram. I wanted to keep it as inexpensive as possible and as a Software Enginner by day figured I'd start with a simple static site generated using Jekyll and hosted on GitHub pages. I pay around $10 per year for the domain name, and so far that's it. If you know anything about how to scale this stack for a relatively image-heavy site, let me know.

#### A note on AI
I use AI tools to help write the code and setup the infrastructure that runs this site, because AI is a useful tool to make writing code simpler and more accessible. _I do not use AI in any capacity for any of the content on this site_ - feel free to contact me with any typos you may find because of it.
